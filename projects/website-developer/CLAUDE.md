# Project guidance

This repo carries the shared Pekaya skill set in `.claude/skills/` (index: `.claude/skills/INDEX.md`):
18 prompt skills (research, summary, ideas, strategy, marketing, content, social, YouTube script, email,
code, debug, website, presentation, learning plan, automation, personas, competitors, custom workflow)
plus `video-2d-infographic-style` for 2D infographic video work.

- Use the matching skill whenever the user's request fits; adapt it to context rather than copying it rigidly.
- Reply in the user's language (Bahasa Melayu / English).
- When creating a NEW repo, run `.claude/scripts/sync-skills.sh <new-repo-path>` to copy these skills into it.

Also included: 52 marketing skills from marketingskills (start with `product-marketing`; upstream `marketing-plan` is `marketing-plan-corey`) and `free-llm-apis`. Sources: `.claude/skills/SOURCES.md`.
